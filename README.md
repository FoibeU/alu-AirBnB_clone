This is the first step towards building the AirBnB clone. 
This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

We will be creating a parent class (BaseModel) for the initialization of future instances. Other classes like (User, State, City, Place..) will inherit from the parent class BaseModel.
